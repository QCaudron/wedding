# The wedding ceremony and reception

The event itself takes place at [Woodland Park Zoo](https://www.zoo.org/). It's a big place -- come to the [Bear Parking Lot](https://goo.gl/maps/kZCgSavnzkApNWCt9) (here are some [directions from the Zoo people](directions_to_parking.pdf)) and you'll enter [at the Bear Entrance](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8Tae6WihHTc5fsAB8).

The Zoo will let guests in at 7pm. Please be there a little early because **the ceremony starts promptly at 7:10pm**, so we can catch the last of the sunlight! Then, we'll have a cocktail reception, and move to dinner at the Otter House.

# The hotel

We booked a block of rooms at the [Courtyard by Marriot Seattle Downtown/Lake Union](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/seacd-courtyard-seattle-downtown-lake-union/overview/). If you'd like to book a room at our discounted rate, you can [use the online system](link_not_here_yet) or call them (206-213-0100) and mention it's for the Hannah Heyrich wedding. The room rate comes to about $260 per night. Careful, there are a few other Marriotts in Seattle with similar-sounding names.

### Getting to the hotel from the airport

From SeaTac Airport, you can take, grab a shuttle, get a taxi, Uber, or Lyft, or use the Light Rail and other public transit.

- An Uber or Lyft will probably cost around $50 to $60. You'll have to head to the [3rd floor of the parking garage to a dedicated pick-up area](https://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac/ground-transportation/app-based-rideshare). After landing, follow signs for "App-based ride share". We usuallydo this as it's the least hassle.
- The [Premier Airport Shuttle](https://premierairportshuttle.com/reservations/?USERIDENTRY=CMLU20&LOGON=GO) needs to be reserved; it's about $26 per passenger.
- The Light Rail is the cheapest option and might be the fastest, depending on traffic, but it doesn't go all the way to the hotel. More info [here](https://www.portseattle.org/page/public-transit-link-light-rail). The Light Rail won't get you all the way to the hotel and you'll have to get a bus from University Street station.
